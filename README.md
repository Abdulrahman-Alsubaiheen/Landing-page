# Landing Page Project

## Table of Contents

## Introduction
Project from Udacity Nanodgree to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.
Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Overview

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

- Built the Navigation dynamically as an unordered list.
- It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.
- When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.
